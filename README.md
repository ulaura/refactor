# Refactor Opportunity

This simple app utilizes React Bootstrap and Highcharts to display a basic dashboard for a user who manages multiple hotels.

Currently all the components are core code reside in the App.js component, and there is a lot of code repitition.

Please fork this repo, and then: 
- refactor and reorganize the files and folders to make the code more D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Feel free to make any design changes to make the UI more enjoyable
- Please update the hotel chart so that it's title includes the hotel ID number

There is not right or wrong answer, just consider this a chance to take some "legacy" code and make it easier for the developer, as well as improve the reliability and presentation for the end user.

Thank you for your time!
